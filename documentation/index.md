# Introduction

Pomona is a framework built for exposing a domain model in a RESTful and hypermedia-driven manner.

It embraces the concept of convention over configuration, and provides opinioned defaults on how
domain model objects is exposed as HTTP resources.

Pomona was born out of frustrations with the difficulties of exposing a complex business domain model
as a RESTful web service.
