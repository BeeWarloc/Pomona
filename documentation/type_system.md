<!--Title:Type system-->
<!--Url:type_system-->

Pomona has its own type system, which mirrors the CLR types combined with
Pomona-specific mapping details and metadata.

# Type mapping

Here's some different types of type specs (...)

* `RuntimeTypeSpec`: For shared and primitive types, also the base class for other type specs
* `ResourceType`: For structured types exposed at an URI as a resource
* `ComplexType`: For structured types with no URI, can be inlined in other objects
* `EnumerableTypeSpec`: Sequences and collections
* `AnonymousType`: For anonymous types generated by C# compiler

By default most primitive types maps to `RuntimeTypeSpec`, and types implementing
the IEnumerable<T> interface maps to `EnumerableTypeSpec`.

All types specified in `SourceTypes` property of the `PomonaConfigurationBase` will
be mapped to `ResourceType` by default.

This behavior can be changed through either <[linkto:configuration/convention]> or
<[linkto:configuration/rules]>.

# Querying the type system

Usually an end-user application will not need to touch the Pomona type system,
so the information below is mostly for corner cases and contributors.

## Converting from and to System.Type

A `TypeSpec` can be converted to its wrapped `System.Type` by either explicit
or implicit casting.

To get a `TypeSpec` from a `System.Type` we need to use the `FromType` method
of the `ITypeResolver` interface.
