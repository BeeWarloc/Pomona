# Pomona

Pomona is a framework built for exposing a domain model in a RESTful and hypermedia-driven manner.

It embraces the concept of convention over configuration, and provides opiniated defaults on how
domain model objects is exposed as HTTP resources.

Pomona was born out of frustrations with the difficulties of exposing a complex business domain model
as a RESTful web service.

## Further reading

Documentation for Pomona is unfortunately still mostly lacking. Until the situation improves the best reference point are the example model and tests found in the source.

Although used for internal API of production systems, Pōmōna should still be considered a work in progress.

## Aknowledgements

Thanks to

* [JSON.NET](ttp://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx) for serialization stuff. h
* [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) for hosting the web service.
  I really love Nancy! I can't overstate how good I think it is! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
  One day I hope Pōmōna will offer a Super-Duper-Happy path just like it.
* [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/) for testing.
* [Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil) for IL generation in client
